Testing instructions are located in the manual, but in order to properly test the program additional hardware is needed.
I will upload a video demonstrating the programming working according to the testing guide and if needed I can do a video call to demonstrate the circuit and program.

In other cases were you can't use the hardware, you can use an oscilloscope to test pin 9 and 10's duty cycle, and the on time duration of enable pins like pin 2 to test the movement.
